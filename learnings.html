    <div class="intro-div">
        <p>The safeID Project was initially pitched under the name “Travel Translator” with the goal of providing users with a convenient way to communicate their allergies quickly and efficiently when traveling abroad.</p>

        <p>However, quickly both the team and the users we interviewed early in the process realized the potential and expanded utility of the application as not only a personalized database for allergies, but also medical information and relevant emergency services.</p>

        <p>Effectively, the team discovered that we could not only encapsulate critical information, but also consolidate the task that currently requires numerous specialty manufacturers of physical cards with limited options or long wait times for custom products. The power of preparation and ease of communication could be placed into the hands of users, and that is what we aimed for in the creation of safeID.</p>

        <p style="text-wrap: wrap;">An interactive prototype was used for user evaluations in order for the team to determine the most appealing and efficient “edit info” page design. Two designs were tested. 
			<br/>
            <br/>
	1.      A drop down menu of checkboxes
			<br/>
            <br/>
	2.      Separate category buttons that take users to separate pages with aligned checkboxes for information selection
<br/>
<br/>
Between the two design variants, the separate category buttons design was, through statistical analysis of our survey responses 
			and quantitative time to complete task metrics, determined to be the more appealing and efficient design by the users.

        <p>The value of safeID lies in  how it can serve its users. To display the most value in the limited screen space of a smartphone, the team listened closely to our evaluators and their feedback. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
User feedback over the course of development followed a common thread.
			<br/>
			<br/>
“Larger buttons” 
			<br/>
“Consistent colors” 
			<br/>
“Less redundancy”
			<br/>
			<br/>
These comments, and the many others the team received, informed our decision to follow a minimalist design that used colored elements on a dark background to guide users to buttons, effectively leading users down a linear path toward core application features.

        <h1> <span >Current</span> Options</h1>
        <p>Current medical ID options are often limited at best in their ability to effectively convey the information stored within. Popular examples, like Apple's own medicalID or physical cards often use a “text box” format that simply dumps information onto boxes on the screen. Despite achieving the goal of displaying the information, it does not provide the most intuitive display and can be cumbersome to edit and enter information.
			<br/>
			<br/>
safeID aims to address the problem of cumbersome information entry as well as improve the effectiveness of the ID display. We achieved these two goals through “checkbox” style information entry and the visual style separation of the information entry page from the ID itself.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Recognizing that the main purpose of an ID is communication from the IDs owner to others, the safeID team aimed to incorporate translation services within the application itself as a defining feature, thus providing users with additional tools for effective communication of the information on their IDs

        <h1> <span >Iterative</span> Design</h1>
        <p>safeID experienced large changes from initial conception to its current state.
			<br/>
The safeID team learned that the most effective way to improve a design is to not only put it through realistic test cases and scenarios but also allow users to leave honest and candid feedback at all stages of the design process. To this end, we made sure to include places for evaluators to leave free form commentary in all of our surveys. This turned out to be an invaluable decision as it brought to light many of the small improvements we could make to safeID.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Freeform feedback also helped safeID refine it’s internal offerings, as users with different conditions and needs left commentary on where the application did, or did not, meet their own needs. Through this process, safeID was able to compile many of the most common conditions and allergies as quick access information in addition to allowing custom entries for users; thus improving and streamlining the overall ID creation process.

        <p style="text-wrap: wrap;">
            The safeID team learned through our research that, overall, our target community is much broader than simply those with<br>
            serious conidtions or allergies. Instead, the user base expands as far as travellers that wish to keep track of their own information, to even <br>
            families that would like their children to have the tools with which they can communicate personal information when away from home. 
            <br> 
            <br> 
            Further, our prospective users displayed strong preferences for a neat, organize list of prexisting choices for conditions <br>
            with the ability to later add custom entries. This method improves not only accessibility but also the versatility of the application.
