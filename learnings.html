<p>The safeID Project was initially pitched under the name “Travel Translator” with the goal of providing users with a convenient way to communicate their allergies quickly and efficiently when traveling abroad.</p>

<p>However, quickly both the team and the users we interviewed early in the process realized the potential and expanded utility of the application as not only a personalized database for allergies, but also medical information and relevant emergency services.</p>

<p>Effectively, the team discovered that we could not only encapsulate critical information, but also consolidate the task that currently requires numerous specialty manufacturers of physical cards with limited options or long wait times for custom products. The power of preparation and ease of communication could be placed into the hands of users, and that is what we aimed for in the creation of safeID.</p>

<h2>Late February: </h2>
<p class="entry">The product was initially pitched as Travel Translator, with a limited subset of options and features envisioned to allow for communication of allergies.</p>

	<p class = "entry">Prospective users were interviewed. Their feedback led to the redesign of our home page to improve button click accessibility by providing larger, more intuitive button controls.
         Color consistency was also highlighted as an important aesthetic feature to facilitate smooth engagement with the interface. </p>
